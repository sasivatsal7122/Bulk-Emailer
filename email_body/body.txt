SUBJECT: MESSAGE FROM OWASP VIIT STUDENT CHAPTER

BODY:

Hello {Name},

Thankyou from the team of OWASP VIIT student chapter for attending the interview commenced by our team. We are here to let you know that you have not 
been selected for the requested position from the 50 short-listed candidates selected by our team.

We recognise and understand that this may be a disappointment to you. On this perspective, 50 candidates have attended the interview and our team should 
appoint only 30 candidates into our team and that's the final result. Our team hope that you understand and support the decision taken by our team.

Your skills, knowledge and creative thinking are very useful to our student chapter and us as students of VIIT. Hope that we work together in further 
programs commenced by our student chapter and explore our knowledge together.


ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS!!!
